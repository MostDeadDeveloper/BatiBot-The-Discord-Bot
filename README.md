# BatiBot-The-Discord-Bot

The Discord Bot that will replace my existence and automate most of my stuff.
Don't Question The Name, I called it that to annoy a certain someone.

# What does this bot even do ? 
This discord bot aims to automate some tasks, that I think most people struggle with in Discord Servers.
As of now one of the major features that I am trying to implement is making the Discord Bot display daily,
upcoming CP (Competitive Programming) Contests around the globe, with the use of the CList API.
# So how do I use this bot of yours?
Install all needed packages by running:
```pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt```

Note: You can also use virtual environment in Python if you prefer so. I reccomend doing so, to properly manage packages in python.
```python3 -m venv myenv```

Run the bot by using the following command:
```python3 app/bot.py```

# Future Changes and Wants
    - Make Bot Mode like an actual bot, reacting to common messages that needs to be responded.
    - Shift to user and bot mode in any form of time, it is not only limited to after a new member joining
    - MAke a channel where they can talk to the bot asking some common or repetitive questions, if it is not in this channel the bot does not reply appropriately.
