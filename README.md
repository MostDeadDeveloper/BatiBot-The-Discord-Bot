# Step 0 : What is Github?  ( Optional)

#### I reccomend you watch this video to get a basic gist of how github works and the process we are conducting.
Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E

# Step 1 : Install Git in your machine

Please install Git in your machine, for you to be able to use it in your respective command line/terminals. (Also known as cmd in windows, and Terminals in Unix Machines)

Use this link as reference.

# Step 2 :  Fork this Repository
There is a clickable button in your top-right, click it and it will give a copy of my entire repository to you.


# Step 3 : Submitting my work

-Go to the repository/directory/folder where this copy of the repository is saved.
- Type the command : ```git checkout -b {YourName}-Branch```
- Type the command : ```git status```
 * Check the files you have modified or changed.
 - Type the command : ```git add --all```
- Type the command : ```git commit -m "Write here what you changed".```
- Type the command : ```git push -u origin {YourName}-Branch```
- Enter your github credentials (username and password)

### I reccomend you do this everytime you are finished coding for the day. That way we can track past and present versions of your work, utilizing Github's version control system.

# Step 4 : Do this part if you have finished something and want to "submit your final answer".
- Go to github and make a pull request and compare your forked branch to my main repository. 

-  Note : A pull request is where we evaluate and finalize your submitted work, and make any possible changes. In the industry, this process is also known as "code review".
